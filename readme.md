This project is a madlibs game made with tkinter. It allows the user to enter a name, 4 objects, 4 adjectives, and 2 verbs. Once all entries are made, the user can click the "Create Madlib" button and the program will generate a madlib story. The user can then click the "Save Madlib" button to save the madlib as a text file.
